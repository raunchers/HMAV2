# HMAV2

This is a refactor of my college capstone project found at: https://github.com/raunchers/HMA  
  
This website is a basic questionaire that will gather, voluntarily, the demographics of visitors to Hickory Museum of Art.

The site will also collect information from Organizations that are visiting the Museum, all voluntary.

The website will be accessed through an IPAD.
