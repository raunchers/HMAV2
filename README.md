# HMAV2

This is a refactor of my college capstone project found at: https://github.com/raunchers/HMA  
  
This website is a basic questionaire that will gather, voluntarily, the demographics of visitors to Hickory Museum of Art. This information is then sent to the State and Federal Governments for State and Federal aid. 

The website will be accessed through an IPAD.
  
The questions are presented one at a time and will only progress when the user clicks to go to the next question. 
  
Questions for non-organizations, all voluntary:
    1. First and Last name
    2. Gender
    3. Zipcode
    4. Group Size (how many adults / children are attending)
    5. Ethnicity
    6. Is the user a member of Hickory Museum of Art
        A. If no, question 7 is presented.
    7. Email Address (if no was selected for question 6)
    8. How did you hear about Hickory Museum of Art

    1. Organization's Name
